## 创新，表象和简单

2014-10-10 
Innovation is everything. When you are on the forefront, you can see what the next innovation needs to be? 
-- Robert Noyce, Founder of Intel

The more things change, the more they stay the same!

The more things seem to be complicated ,the more they are simple in fact!  

失败，首先是理念和策略的失败。  

所谓无我，就是实事求是，“勿意，勿必，勿固，勿我”，不要执着于直觉和初念，甚至把直觉和初念当作需要维护的自我。
